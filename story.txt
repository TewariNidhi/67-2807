There were three little pigs that lived with their mother.
Then one fine day, their mom informed them that they had to move out and make the living for themselves.
They went to find the material to build their own house.
They found some straws, sticks and bricks.
The first pig decided to build his house with only straws.
The second pig built his house with only sticks.
And the last pig built his house with bricks.
